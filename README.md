Advantages:

1. Elements can be easily insert and remove just by updating the pointers.
2. They are dynamic, so their length can increase and decrease as they needed.

Disadvantage:

1. They take more memory than arrays. Because they need to store reference to the other node.
2. Nodes must be read linearly, in the order that they had stored in the data strcture.
